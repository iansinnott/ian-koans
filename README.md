A crash course in the quirks of JavaScript

## The Koans

While coding in JS, I often found myself running into various quirks and inconsistencies in the language. I figured it would be best to document these quirks somehow so I could reference my own work later. I was inspired by the excellent [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) to use unit tests as the medium.

## Unit Tests

All tests make use of the following tools:

- Mocha
- Chai
- Sinon
